My XMonad Configuration
=======================

This is my Xmonad configuration, tailored to my personal use. It
doesn't have any particular goals other than making my use of the
window manager enjoyable.

I'm new at XMonad and at Haskell, so my code may not be the most
readable. It is likely cobbled together from a number of examples.


My Current Setup
----------------

I'm currently working on an 11" Macbook Air running Arch Linux. I
switch between using just the built in display, and a multi-monitor
setup.

As such, this setup will likely tend towards maximizing the use of
limitted screen real estate.
